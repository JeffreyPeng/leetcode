/**
 * 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
 * 
 * There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For
 * each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the
 * horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and
 * hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is
 * always smaller than end. There will be at most 104 balloons.
 * 
 * An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the
 * x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart
 * â‰¤ x â‰¤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An
 * arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the
 * minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
